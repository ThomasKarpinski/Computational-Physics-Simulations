# Solving the 2D Poisson Equation using Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR)

This project implements a numerical solution to the 2D Poisson equation using the Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR) method. The primary focus is on simulating the electric potential within a 2D domain under various boundary conditions and charge distributions.

## Introduction

The core of this project is to solve the 2D Poisson equation:

$$ \nabla^2 V(x, y) = -\frac{\rho(x, y)}{\epsilon} $$

where:
- $V(x, y)$ is the electric potential.
- $\rho(x, y)$ is the charge density.
- $\epsilon$ is the dielectric constant.

The solution is found numerically by discretizing the domain on a grid and using the SOR iterative method to find the potential at each grid point.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into four main tasks. For each task, there is a C++ program that performs the simulation and a Python script for data visualization.

- `poisson_task*.cpp`: C++ source files for the simulations.
- `poisson_task*`: Compiled executables.
- `task*.py`: Python scripts to generate plots from the simulation data.
- `*.csv`: Data files containing the potential, residual, and convergence history.
- `*.png`: Output plots generated by the Python scripts.
- `main.tex`: A LaTeX report detailing the project's background, methods, and results.

## Tasks

### Task 1: All-Dirichlet Boundary Conditions
This task solves the Laplace equation ($\rho=0$) with non-homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions on all four sides of the domain.

### Task 2: Mixed Boundary Conditions
This task solves the Laplace equation with a mix of Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions.

### Task 3: Convergence Analysis
This task investigates how the relaxation parameter, $\omega$, affects the convergence speed of the SOR method.

### Task 4: Non-Zero Charge Density
This task solves the Poisson equation with a non-zero charge density, exploring both homogeneous and non-homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions.

## How to Run

### 1. Compile the C++ Code

To compile the C++ programs, you can use `g++`. For example, to compile `task1`:

```bash
g++ -o poisson_task1 poisson_task1.cpp
```

Repeat this for each task.

### 2. Run the Simulations

After compiling, run the executables to perform the simulations and generate the `.csv` data files:

```bash
./poisson_task1
./poisson_task2
./poisson_task3
./poisson_task4
```

### 3. Generate the Plots

The Python scripts use `numpy` and `matplotlib` to generate plots from the `.csv` files.

First, ensure you have the required Python packages installed:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

Then, run the Python scripts to generate the plots:

```bash
python3 task1.py
python3 task2.py
python3 task3.py
python3 task4.py
```

The output plots will be saved as `.png` files in the current directory.
